There once was a human that wanted to go on an adventure. The human was eager to try something new, but didn't feel creative enough to come up with their own adventure.  The human decided to hire an adventure guide, but not just any adventure guide... a cuddly one. The human wanted to feel safe during the adventure, so having a cuddly guide was the best of both an exciting, new world and a sense of security. The cuddly guide was a koala bear named Fuzz.  The human and Fuzz started their adventure in a mysterious jungle on a nearby planet called Repo of the Milky Way Galaxy.
As Fuzz prepared their pacts he thought about the human. What was his name? Fuzz couldn't remember if his life depended on it. It was just as well. He didn't want to get too attached to the man. It'd taken him so long he had almost lost hope. Finally, finally he'd found someone to bring back to Repo. His masters had not been pleased with his progress but that was all about to change. This man was the key. Stupid man, thinking a safe fun adventure came in such cute cuddly package wrapped in a bow. He fingered the bowtie he'd found on Earth. Yes, this was working out quite nicely.
