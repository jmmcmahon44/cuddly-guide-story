There once was a human that wanted to go on an adventure. The human was eager to try something new, but didn't feel creative enough to come up with their own adventure.  The human decided to hire an adventure guide, but not just any adventure guide... a cuddly one. The human wanted to feel safe during the adventure, so having a cuddly guide was the best of both an exciting, new world and a sense of security. The cuddly guide was a koala bear named Fuzz.  The human and Fuzz started their adventure in a mysterious jungle on a nearby planet called Repo of the Milky Way Galaxy.
